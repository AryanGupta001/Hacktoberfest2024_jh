## Introduction

This is a fun and interactive Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game. You, the player, will be asked to make a choice, and the computer will randomly select one of the options as well. Based on the classic rules, the winner is determined, or the game results in a tie.

## Features

- User-friendly prompts and messages.
- Interactive gameplay with feedback for invalid inputs.
- Simple and clear game logic.
- Randomized computer choices.
- Plays indefinitely (or can be easily modified to end after one round).

## How to Play

The rules are simple:
- Rock crushes Scissors.
- Scissors cut Paper.
- Paper covers Rock.

The game will prompt you to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer will randomly select its choice. The winner will be displayed, or the game will result in a tie if both select the same option.
